Template for DTR Memo
Project: Book Club

Group Member Names: Smitha & Brian

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
Goal to complete functionality with threes at least (or fours). Goal to learn. Goal to complete at least one extension.
Goal to re-DTR twice. We both share the goal of wanting to make a significant contribution.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
We share the microscope pairin quality so should be aware that we both may be hard on ourselves but this can be a strength too since we'll be self aware of our common strength/weaknesses. Initial set up we'd like to do together, and once we have a solid direction can split up the user stories to work on individually, then reconvene.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
Both willing to accomodate in order to achieve goals. We'd like to encourage trying/exploration over the "right" solution.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
Wednesdays 8:00am Smitha meets her mentor
Thursday 6:00pm Smitha leaves
7:00pm hard cut off time for the evening.
5 mmin Pomodoro break every 45 minutes.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):
Daily stand-ups following individual coding sessions and at 6:45pm
Slack, In-person

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

  Technical Strength: Confidence in ability to see big picture, testing
Brian - Areas to improve: Testing with capybara/rspec/simplecov, model vs feature testing

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
Initial set up will be done together, then we'll have a clearer idea on which stories we'd like to target individually.
